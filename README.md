## Visualizing Amazon Textract output with Amazon Neptune

Amazon Textract is a fully managed machine learning service that automatically extracts text and data from scanned documents that goes beyond simple optical character recognition (OCR) to identify, understand, and extract data from forms and tables. 

The output from Amazon Textract is a series of JSON documents representing words, lines, tables, and other document components.  In this example notebook, we show how to ingest this output into an Amazon Neptune graph database and visualize some of the relationships.
